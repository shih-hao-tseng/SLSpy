- File names: use snake case
  e.g., system_models.py

note: In industry people often follow the naming convention strictly, and the
  cases in abbreviations will not be respected. For example, "TCP header" 
  becomes "TcpHeader." In SLSpy, we try to maintain that standard while allowing 
  researchers to read the abbreviations in the original cases, which may look 
  more familiar for the people in academia. Therefore, we adopt a hybrid naming 
  convention below that preserves the cases of the abbreviations. The trade-off 
  is that we will need to insert underscores between abbreviations and other parts
  to avoid weird looking such as LTIFIRSystem.

- Class names: use upper camel case while separating abbreviations by underscores
  e.g., SystemModel, LTI_System, SLS_OutputFeedback_FIR_Controller

- Method names: use lower camel case while separating abbreviations by underscores
  e.g., getControl

- Attribute names: start with a underscore and use snake case
  e.g., _optimal_objective_value
  please feel free to express the variables in the cases they were introduced in 
  the analysis
  e.g., _Phi_x, _Phi_u

- Helper function names: use snake case
  e.g., generate_random_chain
